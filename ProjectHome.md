# VideoSpring #

VideoSpring is being developed by [General Conference Church of God (Seventh Day)](http://www.cog7.org) to meet the needs of [LifeSpring School of Ministry](http://www.lifespringschool.org) and other small educational institutions who need a telepresence solution for distance education but can't afford the expensive professional hardware based solutions.

**Features:**
  * Instructors can teach one or more remote classrooms across the Internet along with remote students viewing from their browsers
  * Full Screen Video/Audio communication between the classrooms and instructor as if they were all present in the same classroom.
  * Up to high def video depending on camera/computer specs
  * Uses [WebM](http://www.webmproject.org) VP8 and [Vorbis](http://www.vorbis.com/) Speex open standards.
  * DirectShow based so most video capture hardware/web cams are supported.
  * Client runs on Windows.  Later support for Linux/Mac may be added.
  * Server runs on Linux.
  * Server component can run on Amazon EC2 so bandwidth is not an issue (just pay as you go).
  * Students who are not able to make it to a physical classroom can watch live via their web browsers. (Requires flash media live encoder and a streaming service like Dacast)
  * Audio conferencing between all classrooms with latency less than cell phone.
  * JPEG slide support.  Pressing F2 will switch to a slideshow mode.

Note: This is not a traditional web conference system where students individually connect using their browsers to learn online.  With this system students physically go to one of any number of physical classrooms where they are able to interact like they would in a traditional classroom but the instructor and some of the other students may be in different classrooms at a different locations.  It does allow for remote students who are unable to attend a classroom to watch live from their web browsers but they are unable to interact other than possibly using text chat to ask questions.
